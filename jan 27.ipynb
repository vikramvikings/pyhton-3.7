      "    Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to\n",

      "    by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an ``import turtle``, give it\n",
      "    the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in\n",
      "    the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the\n",
      "    command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    By combining together these and similar commands, intricate shapes and\n",
      "    pictures can easily be drawn.\n",

      "    \n",
      "    This module is an extended reimplementation of turtle.py from the\n",
      "    Python standard distribution up to Python 2.5. (See: http://www.python.org)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    It tries to keep the merits of turtle.py and to be (nearly) 100%\n",
      "    compatible with it. This means in the first place to enable the\n",
      "    learning programmer to use all the commands, classes and methods\n",
      "    interactively when using the module from within IDLE run with\n",
      "    the -n switch.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Roughly it has the following features added:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Better animation of the turtle movements, especially of turning the\n",
      "      turtle. So the turtles can more easily be used as a visual feedback\n",
      "      instrument by the (beginning) programmer.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Different turtle shapes, gif-images as turtle shapes, user defined\n",
      "      and user controllable turtle shapes, among them compound\n",
      "      (multicolored) shapes. Turtle shapes can be stretched and tilted, which\n",
      "      makes turtles very versatile geometrical objects.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Fine control over turtle movement and screen updates via delay(),\n",
      "      and enhanced tracer() and speed() methods.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Aliases for the most commonly used commands, like fd for forward etc.,\n",
      "      following the early Logo traditions. This reduces the boring work of\n",
      "      typing long sequences of commands, which often occur in a natural way\n",
      "      when kids try to program fancy pictures on their first encounter with\n",
      "      turtle graphics.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Turtles now have an undo()-method with configurable undo-buffer.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Some simple commands/methods for creating event driven programs\n",
      "      (mouse-, key-, timer-events). Especially useful for programming games.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - A scrollable Canvas class. The default scrollable Canvas can be\n",
      "      extended interactively as needed while playing around with the turtle(s).\n",

      "    - A TurtleScreen class with methods controlling background color or\n",

      "      TurtleScreen.\n",
      "    \n",

      "      coordinate-system for the TurtleScreen.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - The implementation uses a 2-vector class named Vec2D, derived from tuple.\n",
      "      This class is public, so it can be imported by the application programmer,\n",
      "      which makes certain types of computations very natural and compact.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Appearance of the TurtleScreen and the Turtles at startup/import can be\n",
      "      configured by means of a turtle.cfg configuration file.\n",
      "      The default configuration mimics the appearance of the old turtle module.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - If configured appropriately the module reads in docstrings from a docstring\n",
      "      dictionary in some different language, supplied separately  and replaces\n",
      "      the English ones by those read in. There is a utility function\n",
